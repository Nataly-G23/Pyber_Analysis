# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to get a better understanding on how much PyBer is making in fares from 3 different city types "Urban, Suburban, and Rural" in a 4 month period.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notbook 6.4.11.

The table above gives a simple but very insightful view on the uneven "Fares" distribution between the 3 city types.
### Rural:
With 'Total Rides'(125) being higher than 'Total Drivers'(78) it shows thet there is a greater demand then supply. A lack in avaibale drivers raises the cost of fare per ride. Betweeen the three city types rural has the highest "Average Fare per Ride"($34.62). The 'Average Fare per Driver'($55.49) is the also the highest out of three city types.

### Suburban:
The city type suburban has a significant increase in 'Total Rides'(625) and 'Total Drivers'(490). Unfortunately if does reflect the same resault of demand being higher then supply. However with the increase in available drivers the 'Average Fare per Ride'($30.97) is less expensive than Rural city fares. It does as well lower the 'Average Fare per Driver'($39.50).

### Urban:
The urban city type has the most significant usage out the three city types. It reflects an opposite story of supply being greater than the demand. Although how often the service is used in urban city types then it's counter parts 'Total Rides'(1,625) the cost of fares is the lowest 'Average Far per Ride'($24.53). Looking at the price that should encourage users to use the service more often. But does it encourage the drivers to be more available? There are 30x more drivers in urban city types vs. rural. 'Total Drivers'(2.405). Because of the grater amount of drivers then rides it makes the fare per driver the lowest 'Average Fare per Driver'($16.57). In comparison to driving in rural that could be discouraging and make drivers less likely to be available.
